# DotNet libraries and example code
The code in the Ringtai.API project provides a mechanism for interacting with the Ringtail Connect API. 

See the ExampleApp to see how to use the Ringtail.API project. 

# Details
There are two basic classes:  Config and Client. 

The Config class is used to read your configuration file located in <home>\.ringtail\config. See the readme in the powershell example for documentation on how to setup your config file.

The Client class is used to communicate with the the Ringtail API endpoint, send commands (queries and mutations) and return results.

See the ExampleApp for more details.
